# 401ChemistryGenealogy.github.io

This site holds various prototypes to show the group check [here](http://401chemistrygenealogy.github.io/)

This [page](https://github.com/401ChemistryGenealogy/401ChemistryGenealogy.github.io/blob/master/index.html) makes use of [flexbox css](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes), and thus does not support IE < version 11. Use a real browswer. However, I have also not spent time optimizing for different browsers or screen resolutions, so I'll include a picture of what the page looks like on my developement end just incase it is rendered poorly on the viewing end.
